# friend-management-app
In this project, I utilized the J2EE Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to develop a web application for friend management. The application enables users to add new friends to MySQL database by providing their details and through backend input validation process. Additionally, users can view and delete any existing friend records as needed.
